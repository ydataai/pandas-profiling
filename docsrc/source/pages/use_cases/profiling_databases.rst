Profiling Databases
==================

``ydata-profiling`` provides overall metrics and statistics for your datasets. However, data is often not stored in a single table but rather across multiple tables in a database.

Databases consist of schemas, each composed of several tables. Being able to profile the relationships between tables, such as primary keys and foreign keys relationships,
while being able to combine it with detailed statistics and metrics per table is crucial to ensure data integrity , effective data management and avoid anomalies.
