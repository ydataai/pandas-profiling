Profiling from Databases
==================

.. NOTE::
   **⭐️ Want to run data profiling directly from your databases?**
   If you're looking for a seamless profiling experience in your organization's datasbases, 
   check YData Fabric's `Data Catalog <https://ydata.ai/products/data_catalog>`_, which allows to consume data
    from different types of storages such as RDBMs (Azure SQL, PostGreSQL, Oracle. etc.), 
    object storages (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, Snowflake, etc.), among others. 
    From single profiling to a trustable and scalable Data Catalog for data teams.
