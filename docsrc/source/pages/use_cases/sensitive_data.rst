Handling sensitive data
=======================

In certain data-sensitive contexts (for instance, private health records), sharing a report that includes a sample would violate privacy constraints. The following configuration shorthand groups together various options so that only aggregate information is provided in the report and no individual records are shown:

.. code-block:: python

  report = df.profile_report(sensitive=True)

Additionaly, ``pandas-profiling`` does not send data to external services, making it suitable for private data.

Sample and duplicates
---------------------

Explicitly showing a dataset's sample and duplicate rows can be disabled, to guarantee the report does not directly leak any data:

.. code-block:: python

  report = df.profile_report(duplicates=None, samples=None)

Alternatively, it is possible to still show a sample but The following snippet demonstrates how to generate the report but using mock/synthetic data in the dataset sample sections. Note that the ``name`` and ``caption`` keys are optional.

.. code-block:: python

  # Replace with the sample you'd like to present in the report (can be from a mock or synthetic data generator)
  sample_custom_data = pd.DataFrame()
  sample_description = "Disclaimer: the following sample consists of synthetic data following the format of the underlying dataset."

  report = df.profile_report(
      sample={
          "name": "Mock data sample",
          "data": sample_custom_data,
          "caption": sample_description,
      }
  )

.. warning::

   Be aware when using ``pandas.read_csv`` with sensitive data such as phone numbers.
   pandas' type guessing will by default coerce phone numbers such as ``0612345678`` to numeric.
   This leads to information leakage through aggregates (min, max, quantiles).
   To prevent this from happening, keep the string representation.

   .. code-block:: python

        pd.read_csv("filename.csv", dtype={"phone": str})

   Note that the type detection is hard. That is why `visions <https://github.com/dylan-profiler/visions>`_, a type system to help developers solve these cases, was developed.
