Warning,Description (per profiling),Notes
Constant,The count of unique values in the column is 1.,
Zeros,Whether the column contains zeros,% and number of zero values is shown in the profiling
High Correlation,Whether the correlations between any two columns (either Spearman, Cramer, Pearson, Kendall and Phi_k correlations) are above the 0.9 threshold,In the profiling, a column can be correlated with multiple others
High Cardinality,Whether the column has more than 50 distinct values,
Duplicates,If there are more than 10 duplicated records in the dataset,"This is a dataset level warning (as opposed to many others which refer only to a specific column)

In the profiling, number and percentage of duplicated records is shown. 
"
Skewness,Whether the distribution of a column is skewed. Threshold to consider a distribution skewed is skewness bigger than 20.,"In the profiling, the value of the skewness indicator is shown. 

Computation/used indicator seems to be different/in a different range compared to whatâ€™s available in the SDK?"
Missing Values,If records are missing from a column,In the profiling, this is a column level indicator with the amount and percentage of missing values shown.
Infinite Values,If any entry in the column is infinite (either np.inf or - np.inf),In the profiling, the number and percentage of infinite values is shown.
Unique Values,Whether the column only has unique values (the number of unique values is the same as the number of values),
Date,Whether the column likely contains Date or Datetime entries,
Rejected,Whether the variable has mixed types or is constant, thus not suitable for further analysis. ,
Uniform,Whether the column values follows a uniform distribution, evaluated through a Chi-squared test score for the distribution with score > 0.999,
Constant length,For columns which are strings/date/datetimes, whether the length of the values is constant (in practice, minimum and maximum lengths are the same),
Unsupported,"If the variable type of a column is not supported (examples: empty, has lists/dicts/tuples, has mixed types)

Currently supported types:
- Boolean
- Numerical real
- Numerical complex
- Date/ Datetime
- Categorical
- URL
- AbsPath (file)
- ImagePath (image-like file)",
E-mail,Whether the column contains emails,The probabilty of a column containing e-mails. SDK has 3 levels: no e-mail, moderate when 50 to 70% of the entires match an email-like pattern, high when more than 70% of the entries match
