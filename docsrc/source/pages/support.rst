Troubleshooting
---------------

First, we need to know whether a problem is actually a bug in the code, or that it's caused by something else, such as your local environment. The first step is to create a new environment with a fresh installation. In many cases, the problem will be resolved by this step.

Frequent issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conda install defaults to v1.4.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some users experience that ``conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling`` defaults to 1.4.1.

More details, `[22] <https://github.com/conda-forge/pandas-profiling-feedstock/issues/22>`_, `[448] <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/448>`__ and `[563] <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/563>`__.

If creating a new environment with a fresh installation does not resolve this issue, or you have good reason to persist with the current environment, then you could try installing a specific version e.g. ``conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling=2.10.0``. 
If it fails with an **UnsatisfiableError** that suggests dependant packages are either missing or incompatible, then further intervention is required to resolve the *environment* issue. However, *conda* error messages in this regard may be too cryptic or insufficient to pinpoint the culprit, therefore you may have to resort to an alternate means of troubleshooting e.g using the `Mamba Package Manager <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba.git>`_.
For an illustration of this approach see `here <https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/655>`_.

Jupyter "IntSlider(value=0)"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When in a Jupyter environment, you see some text, such as ``IntSlider(value=0)`` or interactive ``(children=(IntSlider(value=0, description='x', max=1), Output()), _dom_classes=('widget-interact',))``, then the Jupyter Widgets are not activated. The :doc:`installation` page contains instructions on how to resolve this problem.

If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

You should provide the minimal information to reproduce this bug. `This guide <http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports>`_ can help crafting a minimal bug report. Please include:

- the minimal code you are using to generate the report

- Which environment you are using:

        - operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac)
        - Python version (e.g. 3.7)
        - Jupyter notebook( or cloud services like Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels, etc), console or IDE (such as PyCharm,VS Code,etc)
        - package manager (e.g. ``pip --version`` or ``conda info``)
        - packages (``pip freeze > packages.txt`` or ``conda list``)

- a sample of the dataset (``df.sample()`` or ``df.head()``)
- a description of the dataset (``df.info()``)
