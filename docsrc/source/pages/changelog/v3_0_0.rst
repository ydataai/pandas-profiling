^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

üö® Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration syntax has changed!

The **yaml configuration** now requires the official syntax (e.g. ``null`` instead of ``None``).
The previously used configuration library could not handle comments with indentation - you are now free to use conventional yaml.

For the **python configuration** the ``set_variable`` method has been replaced by more intuitively accessing the configuration object.
For example, you can now set the title in the following way ``report.config.title = "My title"``.

The docs provide additional examples.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``pydantic`` and ``PyYaml`` are dependencies for the new configuration.
- ``confuse`` and ``attrs`` are no longer (explicit) dependencies.
- Upgraded ``tangled-up-in-unicode`` to 0.0.7.
