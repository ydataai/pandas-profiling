TypeError: _plot_histogram() got an unexpected keyword argument 'title'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when using outdated versions of the package.

Ensure that you are using the latest version, and when in a notebook, ensure that you've restarted the kernel when needed.
Also make sure that you install in the right Python environment (please use ``!{sys.executable} -m pip install -U pandas-profiling``!).

Conda installation defaults to v1.4.1
-------------------------------------

Some users experience that ``conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling`` defaults to 1.4.1.

If creating a new environment with a fresh installation does not resolve this issue, or the current environment must be kept, installing a specific version is one alternative to try: ``conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling=3.2.0``. 
If it fails with an ``UnsatisfiableError`` that suggests dependent packages are either missing or incompatible, then further intervention is required to resolve the *environment* issue. However, *conda* error messages in this regard may be too cryptic or insufficient to pinpoint the culprit, therefore you may have to resort to an alternate means of troubleshooting e.g using the `Mamba Package Manager <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba.git>`_.
For an illustration of this approach see `this issue <https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling/issues/655>`_.

Jupyter "IntSlider(value=0)"
----------------------------

When in a Jupyter environment, if only text such as ``IntSlider(value=0)`` or ``(children=(IntSlider(value=0, description='x', max=1), Output()), _dom_classes=('widget-interact',))`` is shown, then the Jupyter Widgets are not activated. The :doc:`../getting_started/installation` page contains instructions on how to resolve this problem.

MemoryError: Unable to allocate... when profiling datasets with very large values
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A memory error that comes up when profiling datasets with large outliers (even if the dataset itself is small), which is due to an underlying bug in ``numpy``, used to build an histogram. Although some `workarounds are suggested on numpy's GitHub <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10297>`_, the bug is not yet fixed. One workaround is to filter out large outliers prior to report computation.

TypeError: concat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'join_axes'
------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue happens when, for instance, a report is converted to an *iframe* via ``ProfileReport.to_notebook_iframe()`` in a notebook environment (Google Colab, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, etc). 

This is due to an incompatibility in an old package version (particularly 1.4.1, which a ``conda`` installation may default to, as discussed above). Upgrading the package to a newer version (either via ``pip install pandas-profiling==3.2.0`` or  ``conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling=3.2.0`` fixes the issue.
